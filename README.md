Put some valid .wav and/or .mp3 files in the `./audio` subdirectory.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000`, and pick one of the files from the select input, then click on the button to prepare the stream data. Wait a little and enjoy.
Run `cleanup.ps1` or `cleanup.sh` if you want to quickly remove the conversion and segmentation results.
